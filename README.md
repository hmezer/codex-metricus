# codex-metricus

Welcome to **codex-metricus**, a personal collection of practically-checked notes, experiments, and learning material.  
Most content is in the form of Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) or RMarkdown files (`.Rmd`).  
All materials are validated by runnable code and serve as a knowledge base for data science, analytics, and programming concepts.

## Contents

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Python-based explorations, tutorials, and experiments.
- **RMarkdown Files**: R-based analyses and documentation.
- **Topics**: Data science, statistics, machine learning, programming tips, and more.

## How to Use

- Browse the folders by topic or language.
- Open `.ipynb` files with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Open `.Rmd` files with RStudio or compatible markdown editors.
- Run the code cells to reproduce results or explore further.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** (for notebooks)
- **Jupyter Notebook/JupyterLab**
- **R** and **RStudio** (for RMarkdown files)
- Check individual files for additional requirements (`requirements.txt`, library imports, etc.)

## Conventions

- Each note is self-contained and includes code that has been tested.
- File and folder names reflect the topic or concept.
- Notes may reference external resources or datasets.

## Disclaimer

This repository is a personal knowledge base.  
Materials are provided "as-is" and may not be production-ready.  
Use at your own discretion.
